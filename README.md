# TranscriptionGemini 🎙️🧠

TranscriptionGemini is a prototype web application designed to convert spoken audio into accurate text using advanced AI models like Gemini. 
Built with Next.js and TypeScript, this project serves as a foundation for scalable transcription services tailored to real-world use cases.

## 🧠 Purpose

This prototype explores the feasibility of integrating Gemini-powered transcription into a modern web interface. 
It is currently under development and intended for internal evaluation, particularly in the context of Highcourt's workflows. 
Based on usage patterns and feedback, this can evolve into a production-grade application deployed via scalable web services.
